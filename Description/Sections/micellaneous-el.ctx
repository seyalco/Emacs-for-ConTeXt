\startchapter[title={About \type{miscellaneous.el}}]

The file \type{miscellaneous.el} is an optional module for Emacs 
that contains small, independent tweaks and micro-utilities 
which improve everyday editing workflow.  
It can be loaded by \type{myextras-loader.el} as part of the user’s 
Optional configuration.

This module gathers configurations that do not require their own separate file, 
including custom deletion functions, editing enhancements, and a few behavior adjustments.

\startsection[title={Purpose}]

\startitemize
\item Provide handy word/backspace deletion utilities for more intuitive text editing.
\item Enable minor editing enhancements that are useful in most coding and writing contexts.
\item Adjust certain global Emacs behaviors for convenience.
\stopitemize

\stopsection % Purpose

\startsection[title={Backspace and Word Deletion Functions}]

This section introduces functions to control how words and whitespace are removed.

\startitemize[n]
\item \bf\type{ryanmarcus/backward-kill-word}  
  Deletes backward intelligently:  
  \startitemize
  \item If the cursor is preceded by whitespace or newlines, it removes them continuously.
  \item Otherwise, deletes a single word backward, using \type{backward-kill-word}.
  \stopitemize

\item \bf\type{delete-backward-word}  
  Deletes \em{ARG} words backward \em{without} saving them to the kill ring.

\item \bf\type{delete-forward-word}  
  Deletes \em{ARG} words forward \em{without} saving them to the kill ring.
\stopitemize

\stopsection % Backspace and Word Deletion Functions

\startsection[title={Keybindings for Deletion}]

\startitemize
\item \type{C-<backspace>} — Calls \type{delete-backward-word}.
\item \type{C-<delete>} — Calls \type{delete-forward-word}.
\stopitemize

These bindings make clean word deletion more efficient during text editing.

\startsection[title={Editing Enhancements}]
